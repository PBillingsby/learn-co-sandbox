These are the Enumerables you should memorize and practice heavily. They're going to be your friends every day in Ruby-land. There are other Enumerables that you might not memorize, but it's pretty common for a developer to realize that they're working in the "Character of Enumerable Methods" and think, "Hmm, maybe there's an Enumerable for that...." When that moment hits, the developer comes back to the documentation and look for that "just-right" Enumerable.

all?: Everything "tested" by the block returns truthy
any?: Did anything "tested" by the block returns truthy
collect: A synonym for map
count: Which elements satisfy the block or, without block, how many elements are there?
detect: Which element satisfies the block first. Does the same thing as find.
find_all: Which elements satisfy the block?
find_index: What is the index of the first element to satisfy the block?
max: What's the highest value?
max_by: What's the highest value based on some property of the element?
min: What's the lowest value?
sort: Put the values in order
